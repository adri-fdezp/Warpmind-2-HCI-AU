The project has been successfully refactored to use Bootstrap for CSS and jQuery for JavaScript.

- `index.html` was updated to include the libraries and restructured with Bootstrap components.
- `styles.css` was simplified to remove styles now handled by Bootstrap.
- `js/app.js` was rewritten to use jQuery, making the code more concise.
- All modified files have been commented to explain the changes.
- The layout has been made responsive using Bootstrap's grid system.
- Emojis were added for a final visual touch.

The application should look and function similarly to before, but the underlying code is now based on these common frameworks, and the UI is now responsive and more visually engaging.
